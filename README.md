# GestureControl
Trying to make interactive images with gesture control

Create and activate a minimal Python virtual environment (keeps project packages isolated).
This makes a private Python environment for GestureCanvas so packages you install wonâ€™t affect your system Python.
""python3 -m venv GestureCanvas-env && source GestureCanvas-env/bin/activate""
